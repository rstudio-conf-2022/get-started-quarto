# 06 - Websites {background-image="images/website.png" background-size="cover" background-color="black" style="font-size: 120px"}

<h2>Building with Quarto</h2>

## Websites

-   Websites are essentially `format: html` + a Quarto Project

. . .

-   Website is different than `format: html` in that it has *multiple pages*
-   Website is our first exploration into Quarto Projects

. . .

-   Website/book are very similar in that they associate multiple pages/resources into a connected resource

## Why not WordPress, Tumblr, Medium.com, Blogger.com, etc?[^1]

[^1]: From Yihui: <https://slides.yihui.name/2017-rmarkdown-UNL-Yihui-Xie.html#36>

-   No R Markdown support (even math support is often nonexistent or awkward)

-   Huge benefits of static websites compared to dynamic websites

-   all static files, no PHP or databases, no login/password, work everywhere (even offline)

-   typically fast to visit (no computation needed on the server side), and easy to speed up via CDN

## Personal blog:

### Create a website

``` bash
quarto create-project MySiteName --type website
```

. . .

### Create a blog

``` bash
quarto create-project MyBlogName --type website:blog
```

. . .

RStudio \> New Project \> New Quarto Blog

<img src="images/quarto-blog.png" width="800px"/>

## Creating a blog

    $ quarto create-project MyBlogName --type website:blog

    Creating project at myblog:
      - Created _quarto.yml
      - Created index.qmd
      - Created posts/welcome/index.qmd
      - Created posts/post-with-code/index.qmd
      - Created about.qmd
      - Created styles.css
      - Created posts/_metadata.yml

## Navigation & Structure

| File                  | Description                |
|:----------------------|:---------------------------|
| `_quarto.yml`         | Quarto project file.       |
| `index.qmd`           | Blog home page.            |
| `about.qmd`           | Blog about page.           |
| `posts/`              | Directory containing posts |
| `posts/_metadata.yml` | Shared options for `posts` |
| `styles.css`          | Custom CSS for website     |

## Create a blog

-   A blog is a website with specific "opinions" already made
-   Includes a listing automatically from `posts` directory
-   Can build custom listings in several ways

## 

<iframe src="https://themockup.blog" height="800" width="1200">

</iframe>

## Core blog workflow

-   Create a new folder under `/posts` - this folder will be the "slug" URL (like `themockup.blog/2022-07-25-new-post/`)
-   Create a new `index.qmd` within the new folder

# `r fontawesome::fa("laptop-code", "white")` Your Turn {background-color="#447099" transition="slide-in"}

-   Create a new RStudio project (in a separate RStudio session) and select Quarto blog
-   Give it a name
-   Explore the directory

## Rendering posts

-   On a specific post, Render with RStudio \> Render
-   Build tab \> Render/Preview Website

These will preview the entire website

. . .

-   Render via termianl with `quarto render` on a specific post - this will just render that specific post

. . .

When you render the website, it will re-execute code in older posts. Not ideal in many situations!

# `r fontawesome::fa("laptop-code", "white")` Your Turn {background-color="#447099" transition="slide-in"}

-   Let's render the `index.qmd` together!
-   Now, let's try Build \> Render Website

## Freeze

> You can use the freeze option to denote that computational documents should never be re-rendered during a global project render, or alternatively only be re-rendered when their source file changes

. . .

``` yaml
execute:
  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render
```

``` yaml
execute:
  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes
```

. . .

`freeze: true` is typically added to a `_metadata.yml` file within a specific directory, affecting all files in that directory.

In the case of a blog - the `_metadata.yml` is saved at the root of the `posts` directory. You can have it only within specific subdirectories for more complex sites.

## Cache

Cache on the other hand, stores the results of computations for a specific file.

> Note that cache invalidation is triggered by changes in chunk source code (or other cache attributes you've defined).

``` yaml
execute:
  cache: true
```

. . .

I typically use cache throughout various types of outputs when I have computationally expensive chunks. Think a `tidymodels` workshop website that is demo'ing with grid-tuning.

# `r fontawesome::fa("laptop-code", "white")` Your Turn {background-color="#447099" transition="slide-in"}

-   Add a `_metadata.yml` to the `/posts/` directory

-   Add the freeze code to `_metadata.yml`

``` yaml
execute: 
  freeze: true
```

-   Render `index.qmd` in the project directory and note the items that are built

-   Explore the `_freeze` directory

. . .

-   Marvel at the "beautiful" JSON - it's not for you, it's for the machine

. . .

To change theme, modify the bottom of your website's `_quarto.yml`

``` yaml
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
```

## Themes

::: {.r-stack}

![](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/theme-solar.png){.fragment}

![](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/theme-morph.png){.fragment}

:::

# `r fontawesome::fa("laptop-code", "white")` Your Turn {background-color="#447099" transition="slide-in"}

-   Open `_quarto.yml` and change the theme to one of the support Bootswatch themes
-   Create a new folder in `/posts/` - title it `2022-07-26-my-first-post`
-   Create a new blank `index.qmd` in that folder, add a `format: html` YAML header
-   Add some text and a markdown image: `![]()`, along with maybe some code :laptop:
-   Render it!

## Adding an About page

    ---yaml
    twitter-card:
      image: images/profile-preview.png
      creator: "@thomas_mock"
    open-graph: true
    title: "Tom Mock"
    image: images/profile-preview.png
    about:
      template: trestles
      links:
        - icon: twitter
          text: Twitter
          href: https://twitter.com/thomasmock
        - icon: github
          text: Github
          href: https://github.com/jthomasmock
    ---

## About page templates

``` yaml
about:
  template: trestles
```

::: panel-tabset
## jolla

![](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/about-jolla.png)

## trestles

![](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/about-trestles.png)

## solana

![](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/about-solana.png)

## marquee

<img src="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/about-marquee.png" width="600px"/>

## broadside

![](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/about-broadside.png)
:::

# `r fontawesome::fa("laptop-code", "white")` Your Turn {background-color="#447099" transition="slide-in"}

-   Open your about page (`about.qmd`)
-   Change some of the details, add more details and choose a specific template (jolla, trestles, solana, marquee, broadside)
-   Render it!

## Landing page

-   The landing page for your website defaults to the blog/listings page
-   `your-proj/index.qmd` becomes your "home page"

. . .

-   `blogdown` users might be used to/prefer your landing page being your "about me" page
-   This is easy to do with renaming your `index.qmd` -\> `blog.qmd` and `about.qmd` -\> `index.qmd`

. . .

-   Re-structuring your website also requires modifying your `_quarto.yml`

``` yaml
website:
  title: "My blog name"
  site-url: "https://MyBlogSiteUrl.com"
  navbar:
    right:
     - blog.qmd
     - icon: twitter
       href: "https://twitter.com/my_user_name"
```

Example: <https://www.ericekholm.com/posts/demo-quarto-site/>

## Listings

![](images/mockup-blog.png){.r-stretch}

## Listings

|  Type   | Description                 |
|:-------:|:----------------------------|
| default | A blog style list of items. |
|  table  | A table of listings.        |
|  grid   | A grid of listing cards.    |

## Listings

::: panel-tabset
## Default

> By default, listings will appear in full width rows that display the item's metadata (author and date), title, description, and image.

<img src="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/listing-default.png" height="400px"/>

## Grid

> Grid style listings display a card for each item.

<img src="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/listing-grid.png" height="400px"/>

## Table

> The table listing style provides a traditional tabular layout.

<img src="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/images/listing-table.png" height="400px"/>
:::

# `r fontawesome::fa("laptop-code", "white")` Your Turn {background-color="#447099" transition="slide-in"}

-   Open your existing Quarto blog from before
-   Let's change the listing type of our blog - change from default to `grid`
-   Re-render the `index.qmd`

## Listing location

``` yaml
---
title: "Listing Example"
listing:
  id: sample-listings
  contents: posts
  type: table
---

You can review the following documents for additional information:

::: {#sample-listings}
:::
```

## Populating listings

``` yaml
---
title: "Listing Example"
listing:
  contents: posts
---
```

. . .

``` yaml
title: "Listing Example"
listing:
  - id: lab-reports
    contents: "reports/*.qmd"
    type: grid
  - id: lab-notes
    contents: "lab-notes/*reports.qmd"
    type: table
```

. . .

``` markdown
Some stuff

::: {#lab-reports}
:::

Some other stuff

::: {#lab-notes}
:::
```

## Manual listings

Sometimes you might want to build out your own listing and link to arbitrary content rather than specific rendered `file.qmd`

``` yaml
---
listing:
  contents:
    - author: First Author
      title: [First Title](a-url.com)
    - author: Second Author
      title: [Second Title](a-url2.com)
---
```

. . .

``` yaml
---
listing:
  contents:
    - items.yml
---
```

``` yaml
- author: Tom Mock
  title: <a href='quarto.org'>An intro to Quarto</a>
- Author: Katie Masiello
  title: <a href='pins.rstudio.com'>Intro to pins</a>
```

## Complex Example:

<iframe src="https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/fake-connectwidgets/" height="800" width="1200">

</iframe>

## Complex Example, `index.qmd` YAML

``` yaml
listing: 
  - id: etl
    contents: "etl.yml"
    type: grid
    grid-columns: 2
    image-height: 100px
  - id: modeling
    contents: "modeling.yml"
    type: grid
    image-height: 100px
    grid-columns: 2
  - id: pins
    contents: "pins.yml"
    type: table
    field-display-names: 
      subtitle: "Description"
      date-modified: "Last Updated"
  - id: api
    contents: "api.yml"
    type: default
    image-align: left
    image-height: 75px
  - id: apps
    contents: "apps.yml"
    type: default
    image-align: left
    image-height: 75px

In your blog project:

``` bash
quarto publish quarto-pub
```

-   Choose a username and/or authenticate with `quartopub.com`
-   Enjoy your new blog/site!

## Websites

Similar to blog, but less of a focus on listing/posts and more focus on individual pages and overall navigation.

<iframe src="https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2022/get-started-quarto/blob/main/_quarto.yml#L8-L38" height="900px" width="1200px">

</iframe>

## Quarto Project

-   <https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html>

> When you create a project, a \_quarto.yml config file is created. Here is an example of what the \_quarto.yml looks like:

``` yaml
project:
  output-dir: _output

toc: true
number-sections: true
bibliography: references.bib  
  
format: #< default format inherited by other documents
  html:
    css: styles.css
```

## More complex example

<iframe src="https://github.com/jthomasmock/themockup-blog/blob/master/_quarto.yml" height="800px" width="1200px">

</iframe>

## Quarto Projects

-   Minimal project has at least 1x file and 1x `_quarto.yml`
-   A project is a directory (and can have sub-directories)

. . .

A typical project is used to:

-   Aggregate content (website/blog/book)\
-   Share metadata (YAML config) across multiple files\
-   Render an entire directory together or redirect output to another directory\
-   Freeze computation across a project or team

## Books

> The structure of a Quarto book can be as simple as a list of chapters, or can alternatively incorporate multiple parts and/or appendices. Quarto book chapters and sections are automatically numbered (for cross-referencing), however you can also specify that some parts of the book should remain unnumbered.

## Book structure

``` yaml
project:
  type: book
book:
  title: "mybook"
  author: "Jane Doe"
  date: "8/18/2021"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - intro.qmd
    - summary.qmd
    - references.qmd
```

``` yaml
bibliography: references.bib
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrreport
  epub:
    cover-image: cover.png
```

## Book crossrefs

> Quarto cross references provide automatic numbering and reference creation for figures, tables, equations, sections, listings, theorems, and proofs. In books, cross references work the same way except they can reach across chapters.
