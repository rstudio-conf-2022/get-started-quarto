## Chilmark

Here is a simple image with a description. This also overrides the
description position and places it to the left of the image.

![Beach in
Chilmark](images/mv-0.jpg){description="Chilmark has a reputation as having some of the best beaches on Martha's Vineyard. Chilmark beaches are resident only in the summer, so be sure to have your proof of residency ready if you'd like to visit one of these special places."
desc-position="left"}

## Elsewhere

The below demonstrates placing more than one image in a gallery. Note
the usage of the `layout-ncol` which arranges the images on the page
side by date. Adding the `group` attribute to the markdown images places
the images in a gallery grouped together based upon the group name
provided.

::: {layout="[[1, 1], [1]]"}
![Aquinnah](images/mv-1.jpg){group="elsewhere"
description="The waves break off the coast of Aquinnah on a beautiful summer day."}

![Oak Bluffs](images/mv-3.jpg){group="elsewhere"
description="Oak Bluffs is famous for its Gingerbread cottages, busy town center, and party like atmosphere."}

![Vineyard lighthouse](images/mv-2.jpg){group="elsewhere"
description="The Edgartown Lighthouse is a short walk from downtown and has beautiful views over the entrance to Edgartown Harbor."}
